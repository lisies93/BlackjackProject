## Blackjack Project


### Description

This is a simple Blackjack game application with the basic rules of the original game,
with the player trying to get as close as possible to 21 without going over,
and the dealer following the house rules (hit on 16, stay on 17).

### How to Run

On launch the starting cards are dealt, two cards each player but only showing 1 card for the dealer.
User is prompted to enter "Hit" and be dealt another card, or "Stand".
If the user score goes above 21 the game will end in a dealer win.
When the user has selected to stay the dealer will take their turn.
The dealer will continue to draw until their score is above 16. If the dealer goes above 21 the player will win.
If neither the dealer or the player scores go above 21, the higher score wins the game.
At the end of each round the user is prompted to enter "Y" to play again or "N" to exit.


### Lessons Learned

I never played Blackjack before so i had fun trying to make the program work, i would say that i am getting more practice building classes whose fields are objects.
